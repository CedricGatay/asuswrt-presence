# AsusWRT presence

Simple script extracting available devices on an AsusWRT router using either telnet or ssh interface

It is a big rip-off of Home Assistant asuswrt plugin with a http server added to serve the response as JSON to consume it with jq (in order to do presence detection by other means)

## How to use it

You will need to enable ssh first in the admin GUI of your AsusWRT router

[source,shell]
----
cp sample.env my.env
# edit the variable according to your environment
docker run -d --restart=always --name=asuswrt-presence --env-file=my.env -p 9090:9090 cgatay/asuswrt-presence
----

Then you will be able to access device list per IP on http://yourserver:9090/

## Disclaimer

This has only be tested on a RT-AC68U for the time being.
